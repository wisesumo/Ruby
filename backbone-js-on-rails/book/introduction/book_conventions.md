## Conventions used in this book

In code samples throughout the book, we include filenames where helpful to give
a sense of typical application structure.  These filenames do not always
correspond to a file in the example application.  When they are included in the
example application, sometimes the inline examples differ from the example
application to illustrate a particular point.
