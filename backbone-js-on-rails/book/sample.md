# Introduction

Welcome to the Backbone.js on Rails eBook sample. This is published directly
from the book, so that you can get a sense for the content, style, and delivery
of the product.  We’ve included three sample sections. Two are specific to
Rails integration: file organization, and a high-level overview of connecting a
Backbone app inside your Rails app. The last is Backbone.js specific, and
covers filtering and sorting your Backbone collections.

If you enjoy the sample, you can get access to the entire book and sample
application at:

# What can I expect from that?

Glad you asked!

The eBook covers intermediate to advanced topics on using Backbone.js,
including content specific to integrating with Rails applications. 

In addition to the book (in HTML, PDF, EPUB, and Kindle formats), you also get
a complete example application, and the ability to get your questions about
Backbone.js and Rails answered by the thoughtbot team.

The book is written using Markdown and pandoc, and hosted on GitHub. You get
access to all this.  You can also use the GitHub comment and issue features to
give us feedback about what we’ve written and what you’d like to see. Give us
your toughest Backbone.js questions, and we’ll see what we can do. Last but not
least, also included is a complete sample Backbone.js and Rails application.
What the book describes and explains, the example app demonstrates with real,
working code. Fully up to date for Rails 3.2.
